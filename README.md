## Thesis Statement
    Countries that have a lower population percentage with electricity will have higher cases of infant mortality.

## Context for Data Visualization
    In this project, I am wanting to see the correlation between the amount of electricity a country has and the mortality rate of infants. Seeing as healthcare is dependent on electricity and technology, it seems that there 
    would be a correlation here.

## Data Visualization Strategies
    For this visualization, a choropleth map was used. Although this map doesn't show anything, it is used as a selector to choose with countries data you want to visualize. The data is visualized through a dual-axis graph, 
    enabling 3 variables (Electricity %, Infant Mortality, and Year) to be shown for the selected country and see the correlation between them. 

## Conclusion
    By visualizing the trends of electricity % and infant mortality rate over time, we can see that the more impoverished countries that have less electricity typically have higher infant mortality rates. By knowing this, we can
    focus on adding more renewable energy sources to these areas, such as wind or solar energy, to increase electricity and in turn decrease the infant mortality rate.
